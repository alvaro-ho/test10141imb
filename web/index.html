       <p>have you ever wondered why the no mater how much you work or how much anyone works, nobody who isn't already rich, has enough money?<br></br>
        this is because the Iluminati doesen't want anyone from the 99% of the populatin with them, they wish to keep the 1% as the 1%. the Iluminati are controling the corvernment and killing Gods country, surpressing everyones freedom, giving us fake rights, and fake choises.<br></br>
        they constantly increase the prices of everythng making us work our asses off, while they lean back in their sunbeds on their yaughts. the same yaughts <strong>our</strong> tax dollars pay for. we as a country, need to rise upp and fight agains our opressors, fight agaist the 1%.<br></br>
        <br></br>now you may tink i'm crazy, but i'm not, i have proof that the Iluminati is real. Photographic evidance.

            <li>one of these is this:<img src="c:\Users\alvar\OneDrive\Pictures\_97980294_yoda.jpg" width="300" height="200"/> as the picture shows, Yoda was at the signing of 1945 UN charter of saudi arabia with King Faisal.</li><br></br> which we all know can't be true since Yoda isn't a real person, but a charter from Star Wars. or is he? i mean how could they have filmed a green short goblin looking creature if it wasn't real, the CGI at the time of filming was not nearly good enough, meaning that Yoda, a Jedi Master has to be real.<br></br>
            <li>as well as this: <img src="c:\Users\alvar\OneDrive\Pictures\download (4).jpg" height="200" width="300"/> we are told this is a picture form the surface of the moon, and yet. we see no stars in the backgorund. why? becasue it wasn't taken from the moon, but a studio on earth. and how come they managed to get to the moon in 1969, but now in 2010, they aren't any more? seem like they're lying about something.</li>
        </ul>
        as well as the fact that the US governmets is constantly being hacked and gets documents leaked, and is yet to crumble, and as we all know, the only compitent president we've had is president Jhon F. Kennedy. but even he was controled by the Iluminati, as they put WWII in sesion, to clence the world, as the Iluminati are raging racists, and since Jhon F. Kennedy wasn't they wanted to ridd the government from him. so as soon as President Jhon F. Kennedy was out in the open, they assainated him. something they have done reacently as well with Donald Trump. Though they must have cheaped out on the assasin since they missed 7 whole shots.<br></br>
        Or did they cheap out?<br></br>
        let's be real, over 7 shots missed, and even though the police didn't call Trump down form his speach after they had discoverd a fully balck clothed sniper on a white roof. doesen't that seem unlikely? first the police knew that the man was pointing a rife at the President, and yet they gave no warning. then they failed to climb up on the same roof with consideribly less weight as they had bothhands and a standard load out of a dingle plated body armor, and their tool belt carrying a G22, and the sniper climbed up with a single hand while carrying a rife in the other. and only after he had emptied his magazine, they nutrilaized him. seem pretty suspitous, doesen't it?<br></br>
        <br></br> then it all comes down to who is the Iluminati? well, the fasion industry of course. it's truly scary how obvious it is when you reallice the facts.
        <!--ol gir meg en ordret liste:grinning_face>:-->
        <ol>
            <li>Designers flabregahsting fasion designs.<br></br>
                let's look at some of the reacent fasion icon designs: <img src="c:\Users\alvar\OneDrive - Buskerud fylkeskommune\Pictures\download (1).jpg" width="200" height="300"/> <img src="c:\Users\alvar\OneDrive - Buskerud fylkeskommune\Pictures\download (2).jpg" height="300" width="200"/> <img src="c:\Users\alvar\OneDrive - Buskerud fylkeskommune\Pictures\download (3).jpg" height="300" width="200"/> <img src="c:\Users\alvar\OneDrive - Buskerud fylkeskommune\Pictures\download.jpg" height="300" width="200"/>
                now what do all these designs have in comon? are they practical? nope. do they look good? nope. are they a waste and flabragasting to look at? YES! the fasoin industry is producing horrible looking, massive, atention seeking degins, and what does this do? upp the prices of all other clothes. and what does this in turn do? upp all other prices, causing massive infaltion. which is what the Iluminati wants, to bankrupt the poor and help the rich.
            </li> <br></br>
            <li>
                World leader assisinations: when you think of world leader assisinations, who do you usualy think of? you might say Abriham Linkon.
                <ul>
                    <li>why was he assainated? <br></br>well, because he stopped slavery in the USA, and who suffred from the loss of cotton pickers? the fasion industry, because without any cotton they couldn't produce any clothes, so they sent an assasin after the president.</li>
                    <li>how did they get an assasin? <br></br>they got it from the same industry they run, think about it, who are the most weak minded people you know of? your answer should be models, and that's who they used to assainate the president, with their own model.</li>
                </ul>
            </li><br></br>
        </ol>
        But world leader assisinations? doesen't that sound fammiliar? yes, because that's exactly what happens in the 2nd age in middle earth after Isildur, son of Elendin, kills Souron and refuses to destroy the Ring from drakness above all other rings. he is shot in his back, resulting in the ring being picked upp by a hobbit, which corrupts him over a 300 year olng period, changing him into the creature Gollum, who gets the ring stolen by another hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, who is forced to give upp the ring to his nefew: Frodo Baggins. who is the protagonist in Lord of the rings, The fellowship of the ring. Possibly one of Tolkens greates works. as Frodo, on his uncles 100th birthday eve, is told by the gray wizzard Gandalf: that he must take the ring, keep it hidden, keep it safe, and take it to Mourdor, into the volcano Mount Doom, and throw it into the magma from whence it was forged. from which he starts his jurny along with his gardener, who heard about the ring, as well Frodo's two cousins. who they stumble appon on the way to Bree to meet with Gandalf at the prancing pony. but on the way they are chased by curesd creatures called Nazgul. who try to kill the hobbits in their sleep, fourtuately. in the prancing pony, they meet a ranger, who happens to be a friend of Gandalf, who says that hell, help them to rivendel to meet with the elves who will help with the ring, since Gandalf fails to show upp after loosing an intence battle with the wite wizzard Saruman. whom has joined forces with Saouron, who is regaining some form and plans to destroy the world. however, on the way to rivendel diring the night while, the ranger named Isildur, is not with the group of hobbits, but scouting. the Nazgul find them and stabs Frodo in the chest, just befor Isildun returns. as the blade of the Nazgul are poisinous to all life, Frodo is dying, and to reduce to poison until they get to Rivendel where the elves can treat him, he sends out one of Frodo's cousins, Pippin, to find a medisinal herb, where he encouters an elf, and hurridly brings her back to his group. the elf after temporarily slowing the poison with her elven magic and the herb, takes Frodo on her horse, and rides in galop for three days to Rivendel, but is percued by the Nazgul as they want the ring frodo bares. however, as they cross a river, she calls apon the flood and gets rid of the Nazgul for now, before reacing Rivendel, for frodo to be treated. which he is. and when he wakes, he is met by not only his freinds, but also his uncle Bilbo who went to rivendel to escape the powers of the ring. and gifts frodo his elven sword he had gotten on his adveture where he had gotten the ring. as well as a pice of chainmail made of mithril, which is light as a feather, yet can not be pierced by any sword, spear nor arrow, before being possesed slightly by the powers of the ring, and almost reaches for it, then cries, ashamed Frodo had to see that. Frodo is then called to a seacret meeting with the lord of rivendel: elron, who witnesed Isildur keep the ring. as well a dwarf called Baldin, an elf called Legolas, Isildun as well as another man called Boromir who is the heir to the kingdom of Gondor. and they meet for the planning of the destruction of the ring. then being dubbed the Fellowship ofthe ring by Elron, before the meeting is intoroupted by Samwise (fordos gardener and bestfriend.), Pippin and Merry(Frodos coisuns.) who say that frodo wont go anywhere without them, and they join the fellowship, before they leave for mordor.
